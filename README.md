Product Listing and Filtering Application

A simple JavaScript-based web application that fetches products from the Fake Store API and displays them with options to filter by category, title, and price range.

Features
Category Filter: Filter products by categories like men's clothing, jewelry, electronics, and women's clothing.
Title Search: Search products by title or keywords.
Price Range Filter: Adjust the price range slider to display products within a specific budget.
How It Works
Fetching Products: Products are fetched from different categories on page load and stored in a global array for easy filtering.
Displaying Products: Products are displayed in a grid, each within a styled div.
Filtering: Use the dropdown to filter by category, the search bar to filter by title, and the slider to filter by price.
